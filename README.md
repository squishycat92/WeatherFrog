# WeatherFrog
WeatherFrog is a Scriptable script that shows a cute frog in the form of a widget! This frog is depicted in various weather conditions, which are based off of the conditions at a predefined location.


**Demonstration:**

**How to use:** in order to use this script, please first generate a city identifier using `cityIdentifier.js` (paste this as a script into Scriptable). Then, you can use the information provided as output to plug the variables `API_WEATHER`, `CITY_WEATHER`, and `UNIT_TYPE`. Please note that you must also have an OpenWeatherMap API Key ready for use (generate one if you don't have one).


This script was inspired by a Scriptable script found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSsetups/comments/j3y4g7/google_frog_weather_style_widget_setup_scriptable/) on reddit by [sharn25](https://gist.github.com/sharn25).
