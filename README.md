# WeatherFrog
WeatherFrog is a Scriptable script that shows a cute frog in the form of a widget! This frog is depicted in various weather conditions, which are based off of the conditions at a predefined location.

In order to use this script, please first generate a city identifier using `cityIdentifier.txt` (paste this as a script into Scriptable). Then, you can use the information provided as output to plug the variables `API_WEATHER`, `CITY_WEATHER`, and `UNIT_TYPE`.

This script is based on a Scriptable script found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSsetups/comments/j3y4g7/google_frog_weather_style_widget_setup_scriptable/) on reddit by [sharn25](https://gist.github.com/sharn25). All original rights belong to the original author of this script.
